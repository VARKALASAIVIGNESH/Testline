# Quiz App with Machine Learning and Line Chart Visualization

## Repository
**GitHub Link**: [Quiz App Repository](https://github.com/VARKALASAIVIGNESH/Testline)

## Description
This project is a Flask-based web application designed for interactive quizzes, personalized feedback, and historical score tracking using visualizations. It also incorporates machine learning to provide recommendations for improvement based on past performance.

## Features
- **Quiz Functionality**: Users can take quizzes on various topics and immediately view their results.
- **Performance Feedback**: Displays metrics like accuracy, score, and mistakes made.
- **Historical Comparison**: Compares current performance with historical data.
- **Interactive Line Chart**: Uses Chart.js to render a line chart of historical scores (final scores).
- **Machine Learning Recommendations**: Provides feedback based on predictions from a pre-trained model.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Backend framework to build the web app.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implements machine learning functionality (Random Forest model).
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript library for interactive line charts.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design and layout.
- **JSON**: Data storage for quizzes and historical records.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Pip**: Comes bundled with Python, used for installing dependencies.
- A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VARKALASAIVIGNESH/Testline
   cd Testline
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

    "questions": [
      {"question_id": 1, "question_text": "2 + 2 = ?", "correct_answer": "4"}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### `submission_data.json`
```json
{
  "correct_answers": 8,

## Features Breakdown

### 1. **Home Page**
Navigate to the home page to start quizzes or view historical results.

### 2. **Results Page**
After completing a quiz, view:
- Accuracy, final score, and performance level.
- Historical score comparison visualized as a line chart.
- Recommendations for improvement based on mistakes and machine learning predictions.

### 3. **Historical Line Chart**
Utilizes `Chart.js` to display a line chart of historical quiz performance. Each data point represents the score of a past quiz.
