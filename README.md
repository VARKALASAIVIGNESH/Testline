## Features
- **Quiz Functionality**: Users can take quizzes on various topics and immediately view their results.
- **Performance Feedback**: Displays metrics like accuracy, score, and mistakes made.
- **Historical Comparison**: Compares current performance with historical data.
- **Interactive Line Chart**: Uses Chart.js to render a line chart of historical scores (final scores).
- **Machine Learning Recommendations**: Provides feedback based on predictions from a pre-trained model.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Backend framework to build the web app.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implements machine learning functionality (Random Forest model).
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript library for interactive line charts.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design and layout.
- **JSON**: Data storage for quizzes and historical records.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Pip**: Comes bundled with Python, used for installing dependencies.
- A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VARKALASAIVIGNESH/Testline.git
   cd Testline
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
